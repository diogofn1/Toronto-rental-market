# Project overview
This project explores rental market trends in Toront through data collection, analysis, and visualization. A custom web scraper was developed to extract real estate listings from property.ca. The collected data was then cleaned, analyzed, and visualized to identify key factors influencing rental prices.

# Objetives
- **Develop a Web Scraper:** Implement a Python-based scraper capable of systematically extracting rental listing data.
- **Data Collection:** Gather structured data on rental properties, including location, price, size, and other features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze market trends, identify patterns, and evaluate key drivers of rental pricing.
- **Data Visualization & Insights:** Present findings through visualizations and statistical summaries to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

# Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**

  - **Web Scraping:** requests, BeautifulSoup, re (Regular Expressions)
  - **Data Processing & Analysis:** pandas, numpy, statsmodels
  - **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn

# Skills employed in the project
- **Web Scraping:** Automated data extraction from a real estate platform.
- **Data Wrangling & Cleaning:** Handling missing values, normalizing data, and structuring datasets for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovering patterns, trends, and statistical relationships within the rental market.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Using pandas and statsmodels to explore pricing correlations and relationship between price and size.
- **Data Visualization:** Communicating insights effectively through plots and summary statistics.
- **Report Writing & Documentation:** Structuring findings in a clear, professional manner.

# Key Insights from the Analysis (September 2024)
- Size and location seems to play an important role when it comes to renting price.
- As the size of a unit increases, so does its renting price.
- The vast majority of properties in the renting market have one or two bedrooms.
- Some regions of Toronto seem to offer a better price for renting units with more bedrooms (3 bedrooms), such as East York, Etobicoke and York-Crosstown, while Downtown, Midtown and West End seem particularly pricey for these type of properties.
- Average price per square foot in Toronto: $4.20 CAD.
- Above-average regions regarding price per square foot: Downtown, Midtown, and West End.
- Top 10 most expensive neighborhoods: Little India, Yorkville, Playter Estates, Grange Park, Forest Hill, King West, Queen West, Seaton Village, Church St Corridor, Yonge & Bloor ($4.80-$5.25 CAD per sq. ft.).
- Top 10 most affordable neighborhoods: Kingsview Village, Richview Lawrence Park, Scarborough Village, Long Branch, Riverdale, Markland Wood, Victoria Village ($1.89â€“$3.28 per sq. ft.).

This project provides a data-driven approach to evaluating rental prices, offering insights that can help renters make informed decisions. The average price per square foot metric serves as a valuable benchmark for price evaluation across different neighborhoods.
